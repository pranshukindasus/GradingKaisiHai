# Grading Kaisi Hai?
Choosing courses during pre-registration and the add-drop period can be a tiresome job. Here is a tool to make your life easier.

**Simply enter the name of the professor whose past grading you wish to look at, and voila! there it is!**

General Instructions:
1. This program runs only on Windows with Chrome installed.
2. You NEED to be connected to IITK\'s campus network to use this. Use Forticlient VPN if you\'re off-campus.
3. The Program can display grades\' distributions till 2024-25 Odd Semester.
4. Please try different permutations of the Professor\'s name whom you wish to look for.\nFor Example, Professor "Manoj K Harbola" goes by the name M K Harbola in the dataset. You may also type "Harbola" and get the same results. \nHowever 
   "Manoj K Harbola" will not work. You may visit "http://172.26.142.68/dccourse/" to look up valid names in case of confusion.
5. The Program displays grades of all Professors who satisfy the name you enter. \nFor Example, "Abhishek" will display grades for "Abhishek Gupta" as well as "Abhishek Sarkar". \nHence, please be careful with the name you enter. ')
